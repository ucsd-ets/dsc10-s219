    "**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Friday, September 6. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. Only one of you should submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org) and [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for the final exam and your future in data science. If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels or that your answer is of the correct type. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells, and you can add additional cells as needed.\n",

    "All of the concepts necessary for this project are found in the textbook. If you are stuck on a particular problem, reading through the relevant textbook section often will help clarify the concept.\n",
